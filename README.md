# Introduction

This repository contains some tools and notes that aid research software development.

RSE stands for Research Software Engineer, but these tools are free to use by anyone who finds them potentially useful.

# Motivation

When developing research packages, a developer might write some functions and scripts to make development easier. Such auxiliary files are not to be part of the released package. They may, however, be repurposed for another project. Therefore, it makes sense to put these tools in one place (i.e., this repository).

Moreover, having such tools in one repository makes it easier for the user to clone one repository, include it in their `$PATH` and easily execute the scripts.
